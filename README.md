## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install confpickem
```

## Quick Start

### Command Line Interface (Recommended)

The easiest way to use confpickem is through the command-line tools:

```bash
# Optimize your picks for mid-week with live odds
confpickem --week 10 --mode midweek --live-odds

# Check win probabilities for all players
confpickem-win-probability --week 10 --live-odds

# Update player skills from historical data
confpickem-player-skills update --weeks 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 --week 10
```

**Installation:** Install the package to get these commands:
```bash
pip install -e .   # From project root
```

See the [CLI Documentation](CLI_README.md) for full details.

### Python API

You can also use the package programmatically:

```python
from confpickem import YahooPickEm, ConfidencePickEmSimulator, run_simulation

# Initialize scraper with your league info
yahoo = YahooPickEm(
    week=1,
    league_id=YOUR_LEAGUE_ID,
    cookies_file='cookies.txt'
)

# Run simulation with actual picks
simulator, stats = run_simulation(yahoo)

# Print expected points and win percentages
print("\nExpected Points by Player:")
print(stats['expected_points'])
print("\nWin Percentages:")
print(stats['win_pct'])
```
